		I am a designer and artist first and foremost. But I am also passionate about crafting experiences, whether that is a video, a website, an article, or a piece of physical art. In my last position as Content Producer and Assistant Editor, I had the rare opportunity to take on a wide breadth of responsibilities. I worked in front of and behind the video camera, helped craft online communities through social media and blogging, wrote and edited instructional articles, and more. In all mediums, I use my creative eye to find new ways to engage audiences.
	<br>
		I now want to play a larger role in designing the overall experience of a companyâ€”an experience that bridges the physical and digital worlds.
